# Keyboard Layouts

This is a collection of custom keyboard layouts for Windows that I created over the years.

- `MacUK.klc` - clone of Apple's British layout as included with Boot Camp software, useful for installation in VMs or for when you don't want to install Boot Camp
- `RU_UK.klc` - phonetic Russian keyboard adapted to British layout (Q -> л», W -> ле, etc)
